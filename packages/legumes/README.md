ðŸŽ¼ _A sheet music to polylines renderer_

**[Samples](./samples) | [Online Editor](https://legumes.netlify.app/) | [API](API.md) | [Syntax](SYNTAX.md)**

<img src="screenshots/000.png" width="400"/>

In goes a midi file or a [simple markup format](SYNTAX.md), and out comes âœ¨polylinesâœ¨, which can then be used for animation, plotting and various procedural drawing fun.

> ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress and currently supports a subset of sheet music notation. Errors and ugliness might occur from time to time<sup>\*</sup>. For professional quality scorewriting, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scorewriters instead. ðŸš§

## Features

- Supports most everyday classical music symbols;
- Exports polylines, svg, pdf, gif, midi and more;
- Lightweight: < 150KB minified; No dependencies;
- Uses [Hershey Fonts](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/hershey/) for text and symbols; You can load custom hershey fonts for rendering unicode etc;
- Includes basic animation and handdrawn effects generator;
- Use as browser/node.js library or commandline interface.

For examples, below are the first couple measures of Grieg's "Solitary Wanderer", typeset in legumes, with regular, animated and hand-drawn styles:

You can find at the bottom of this document the full score, or better yet, **Checkout the [samples](./samples) folder** for a more comprehensive showcase featuring music by various composers!

<sub>*legumes is an acronym for *Lingdong's Erratic and Generally Useless Musical Engraving System\*.</sub>

## Usage

The easiest way to try out the project is by using the [Online Editor](https://legumes.netlify.app/), which supports syntax highlighting and midi playback. For more advanced usage, there're commandline and programming interfaces, described below:

### Commandline

The [`legc` executable](./legc) included in the repo is a shebang'ed node.js script. You can easily invoke it in the commandline via `./legc` (or `legc` if placed/aliased in PATH) if you have node.js installed.

Minimal example, rendering a score to SVG:

```
legc --format svg samples/minuet_G.txt > output.svg
```

Another example, render a score to an animated svg, specifying some rendering options:

```
legc --format svg-anim \
  --stem-length 3 --title-text-size 28 --page-margin-x 120\
  samples/minuet_G.txt > output.svg
```

The commandline tool supports some 50+ rendering/export options, view the full list by typing:

```
legc --help
```

### Programming

Built JavaScript files acn be found in `dist/` folder. Import them via

```html
<script src="dist/legumes.min.js"></script>
```

or

```js
const legumes = require('dist/legumes')
```

You can find the full API doc [here](API.md), but here's a minimal example:

```js
const txt = fs.readFileSync('samples/minuet_G.txt').toString()

// build a score from the text-based markup
const score = legumes.parse_txt(txt)

// compile the score to pre-compute properties for drawing
legumes.compile_score(score)

// draw the score
let drawing = legumes.render_score(score)

// export drawing to SVG format
let svg = legumes.export_svg(drawing)

fs.writeFileSync('output.svg', svg)
// document.body.innerHTML = svg;
```

You can configure rendering options via the `CONFIG` object, e.g. :

```js
legumes.CONFIG.STEM_LENGTH = 3
legumes.CONFIG.DURATION_BASED_SPACING = 0.07
legumes.CONFIG.LYRIC_SCALE = 0.8
```

Midi files can also be rendered, but note that midi is not a suitable format storing sheet music, and educated guesses has to be made converting it to one:

```js
let bytes_in = Array.from(new Uint8Array(fs.readFileSync('input.mid')))
let midi_file = legumes.parse_midi(bytes_in)
let score = legumes.score_from_midi(midi_file)
legumes.compile_score(score)
fs.writeFileSync('output.svg', legumes.export_svg(drawing))
```

What one could do, is read a midi file, and export it as markup text, make improvements by hand, and render the latter instead:

```js
let bytes_in = Array.from(new Uint8Array(fs.readFileSync('input.mid')))
let midi_file = legumes.parse_midi(bytes_in)
let score = legumes.score_from_midi(midi_file)
let txt = legumes.export_txt(score)
fs.writeFileSync('score.txt', txt)
```

In addition to the supported input file formats, you can construct your own score object to feed into legumes, as long as it conforms to the interface:

```ts
interface Score_itf {
  title: string[]
  composer: string[]
  tempo?: Tempo_itf
  instruments: Instrument_group_itf[]
  slurs: Slur_itf[]
  measures: Measure_itf[]
  crescs: Cresc_itf[]
}
```

You can find more details about these interfaces in [API doc](API.md) and `src/common.ts`.

legumes render with several stages. You can unplug the final polylines output and write a custom renderer that interprets the computed element layout. For example, visualize the elements with `export_mock_svg` routine:

```js
let drawing = legumes.render_score(score, { compute_polylines: false })
let svg = legumes.export_mock_svg(drawing)
```

More details can be found in `src/drawing.ts`.
